## 📏 CRITICAL MEASUREMENTS

### **Code Requirements (Fairfax County)**
- **Post spacing:** 8' max
- **Joist spacing:** 16" on center
- **Railing height:** 36" minimum
- **Baluster spacing:** 4" sphere can't pass through
- **Stair rise:** 7¾" maximum
- **Stair run:** 10" minimum

### **Lumber Sizes (Actual)**
- 2x8 = 1½" × 7¼"
- 2x10 = 1½" × 9¼"  
- 2x12 = 1½" × 11¼"
- 4x4 = 3½" × 3½"
- 5/4x6 deck board = 1" × 5½"

## 🔧 QUICK CALCULATIONS

### **Concrete Needed**
**Per Hole:** 2 bags (80 lb) for 8" diameter × 30" deep  
**Total bags needed:** (# of holes) × 2

### **Joist Spacing**
**16" centers:** Measure 15¼" from center of one joist to start of next

### **Deck Screws**
**Per sq ft:** ~15 screws for decking  
**5 lb box:** ~350 screws = ~23 sq ft coverage

### **Stair Formula**
**Rise + Run = 17-18 inches** (comfortable step)  
**2 × Rise + Run = 24-25 inches** (safety check)
