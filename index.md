## üìñ Construction Specification Examples

### Grading Analysis Example
*"Site analysis for 16x20 deck with 3% slope toward east side of house requires French drain installation with 4-inch perforated pipe, 6-inch gravel base extending 2 feet beyond deck perimeter, and soil amendment with 3 cubic yards of engineered fill."*

**‚Üí Generates:** Detailed grading plan, drainage calculations, soil preparation requirements

### Footer Specifications Example  
*"Structural analysis determines 12 concrete footers required: 8 perimeter footers at 42-inch depth below frost line, 4 interior beam supports at 36-inch depth, spaced 8 feet on center to support 40 PSF live load for 16x20 deck with composite decking."*

**‚Üí Generates:** Foundation plan, concrete calculations, reinforcement requirements, inspection schedule

## üèÜ Construction Success Stories

> *"Got exact footer specifications with load calculations - passed structural inspection on first try with zero corrections needed. The AI calculated everything perfectly."* - **Professional Contractor**

> *"The grading analysis prevented major drainage issues. AI calculated exactly how much soil to move and identified the need for French drain before we started digging."* - **DIY Builder**

> *"Material list was so detailed I got competitive bids from 3 suppliers and saved $2,400 on lumber alone. Quantities were spot-on."* - **Experienced Builder**
